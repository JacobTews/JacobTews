### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syedareehaquasar/syedareehaquasar/master/gifs/Hi.gif" alt="waving hand" width="30px"/> Hi! I'm Jacob, and I am on a journey to understand the world through its data! :bowtie:
<br/>

I am turning the page to a new chapter of my life, diving wholeheartedly into a pivot to **data science**, \
after more than a decade as a university music professor and orchestra conductor. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bring tools from my current career, like
- collaborative excellence,
- clarity of communication, and 
- creative problem-solving, <br/><br/>


to which I have added skills in...
- Python &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :snake:
- SQL &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; :computer:
- R &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; :pirate_flag:
- data visualization &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :bar_chart:
- machine learning &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- statistics &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; :abacus:
- hypothesis testing &emsp; :test_tube:
- marketing &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :money_with_wings:
- StackOverflowing &emsp;&nbsp; :grin:

...and more!
