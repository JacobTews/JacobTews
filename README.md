### :wave: Hi, I’m Jacob Tews, and I’m on a journey to understand the world through its data! :bowtie:
<br/>

After more than a decade as a university music professor, I am turning the page to a new chapter of my life, \
diving wholeheartedly into a pivot to data science.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the tools you might expect from my current career, like
- excellence in collaboration,
- clarity of communication, and 
- creative problem-solving,

I have skills in and am developing experience in ...
- Python &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :snake:
- SQL &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; :computer:
- R &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; :pirate_flag:
- data visualization &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :bar_chart:
- machine learning &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- statistics &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; :abacus:
- hypothesis testing &emsp; :test_tube:
- marketing &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :money_with_wings:
- StackOverflowing &emsp;&nbsp; :grin:

...and more!
